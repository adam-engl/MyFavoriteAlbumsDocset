- **Explore your album rankings by year**, seeing how your musical taste has evolved
- **Analyze an artist's presence in your collection**, including average ratings and total albums
- **Compare ratings between different artists** to see whose work you consistently rate higher
- **Identify trends in your music collection** across different time periods
- **Analyze your vinyl collection** to discover highly-rated albums you don't yet own
- **Visualize your music preferences** through charts and organized tables

### What MyFavoriteAlbums Cannot Do

To understand the application's scope, it's also important to know what it doesn't do:

## Key Concepts in MyFavoriteAlbums

To understand how the application works, it's helpful to be familiar with these core concepts:

### Album Rankings vs. Ratings

- **Ranking**: The position of an album relative to others from the same year (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
- **Rating**: Your numerical score for the album on a scale from 0-10

These two concepts work together but serve different purposes. Rankings show relative preference within a year, while ratings allow comparison across different years.

### Collection Attributes

MyFavoriteAlbums tracks several key attributes for each album:

- **Year**: When the album was released
- **Artist**: Who created the album
- **Vinyl Ownership**: Whether you own a vinyl copy
- **Release Type**: Whether it's a standard album, EP, or live recording

These attributes serve as the foundation for different types of analysis and filtering.

### Organizational Structure

The application organizes music information along several dimensions:

- **Chronological**: By release year
- **Artist-focused**: By band or musician
- **Format-based**: By vinyl ownership
- **Quality-based**: By your numerical ratings

This multi-dimensional organization allows for flexible exploration of your collection.

### Required Software <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The application is built on:

- **R**: A powerful data analysis system
- **Shiny**: A framework for creating interactive web applications
- **Various R packages**: Specialized tools for data manipulation and visualization

### Data Format

Your music information is stored in a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file, which is a simple text file that can be opened in Excel or any text editor. Each row represents one album, and the columns are:

- **Year**: The release year (e.g., 2024)
- **Ranking**: The album's position that year (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **Album**: The album title
- **Artist**: The band or musician name
- **Rating**: Your score from 0-10
- **Vinyl**: "v" if you own it on vinyl, blank if not
- **EP**: "EP" if it's an extended play, blank if not
- **Live**: "Live" if it's a live recording, blank if not

For example, your CSV file might look like:

```csv
Year,Ranking,Album,Artist,Rating,Vinyl,EP,Live
2023,1,Guts,Olivia Rodrigo,9,v,,
1984,1,Hatful of Hollow,The Smiths,10,v,,
