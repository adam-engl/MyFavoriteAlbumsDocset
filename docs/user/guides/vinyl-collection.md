## Exploring Your Vinyl Collection

**Audience:** Music enthusiasts who want to analyze their vinyl collection

**Prerequisites:**

- Access to the MyFavoriteAlbums web interface
- Your album rankings data uploaded to the application with vinyl information

**Steps:**

1. From the main interface, click on the _Vinyl_ tab.

2. Review the two main sections that appear:

   - _"Top-rated vinyl that I don't own"_
   - _"Years for which I own the most vinyl"_

3. In the first section, review the table of highly-rated albums (rating 9 or above) that you don't own on vinyl.

   > The "Top-rated vinyl that I don't own" table can help you identify potential vinyl purchases to prioritize.

4. In the second section, examine the table showing which years have the most representation in your vinyl collection.

   > The "Years for which I own the most vinyl" table helps you understand the temporal distribution of your collection.

5. Look for patterns in your vinyl collection:

   - Are there specific eras you collect more heavily?
   - Are there highly-rated albums you might want to add to your collection?

   > **Note:** The information on this tab updates automatically based on your data file, so no user input is required.
