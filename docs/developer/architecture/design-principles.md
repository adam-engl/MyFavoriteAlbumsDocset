## Design Principles

MyFavoriteAlbums embodies several key design principles:

### Functional Programming Approach<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The code uses a functional programming style where:

- Data transformation is handled through pure functions
- Each function performs a specific, well-defined operation
- Functions are organized into thematic modules

### Separation of Concerns<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The application maintains clear separation between:

- Data access and management
- Business logic and analysis
- User interface and presentation

### Reactivity Model<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The Shiny application uses a reactive programming model where:

- User inputs trigger recalculation of dependent values
- Outputs automatically update when their inputs change
- Data flows through the application in a predictable manner

## Conceptual Challenges and Considerations

Developers working with MyFavoriteAlbums should be aware of several conceptual challenges:

### State Management<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The application handles state primarily through:

- The central data source (read at startup)
- User input values (stored in Shiny's reactive framework)
- Derived calculation results (e.g., average ratings by artist, vinyl ownership counts by year, filtered album lists based on user selections)

There is no persistent state beyond the initial data load.

### Data Transformation Pipeline<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The data follows a transformation pipeline:

1. Raw CSV data (structured but unprocessed)
2. Filtered subsets (based on user selections)
3. Calculated results (statistics, aggregations)
4. Formatted output (tables, charts, text)

Understanding this pipeline helps in comprehending how data flows through the system.

### UI/Logic Separation<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The application maintains separation between:

- What the user sees (defined in app_ui.R)
- How the system responds (defined in app_server.R)
- What calculations occur (defined in function modules)

This separation enables independent evolution of each aspect.
