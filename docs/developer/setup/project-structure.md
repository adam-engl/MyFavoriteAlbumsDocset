## Understanding the Codebase Structure

**Audience:** Developers who want to understand how the MyFavoriteAlbums code is organized

**Prerequisites:**

- Completed development environment setup
- Basic knowledge of R programming

**Steps:**

1. Open RStudio and navigate to the MyFavoriteAlbums project.

2. Open the main app.R file to understand the application's entry point:

   ```r
   file.edit("app.R")
   ```

3. Examine the structure of app.R:

   - The file loads necessary libraries
   - Sources all component files using the `source()` function
   - Creates a Shiny application using `shinyApp()`

4. Identify the key component files:

   - `app_ui.R`: Defines the user interface structure
   - `app_server.R`: Contains the server logic that responds to user inputs
   - `albums_by_band.R`: Functions for artist-based analysis
   - `albums_by_year.R`: Functions for year-based analysis
   - `number_one_albums.R`: Functions for analyzing top-ranked albums
   - `vinyl.R`: Functions for vinyl collection analysis
   - `compare_bands.R`: Functions for comparing artists
   - `data/album-rankings.csv`: The data file

5. Open the UI file to understand the interface structure:
   ```r
   file.edit("app_ui.R")
   ```
6. Note the key UI components:

   - A `fluidPage` that contains all UI elements
   - A `tabsetPanel` that creates the tabbed interface
   - Individual `tabPanel` elements for each analysis section
   - Input controls (sliders, dropdowns, buttons)
   - Output placeholders (`tableOutput`, `plotOutput`)

7. Open the server file to understand the application logic:

   ```r
   file.edit("app_server.R")
   ```

8. Note the server function structure:
   - Output renderers that populate UI elements with data
   - Event observers that respond to user actions
   - Function calls that process data
9. Open one of the analysis module files to understand the function design:

   ```r
   file.edit("albums_by_band.R")
   ```

10. Note that each module typically:
    - Loads the data from CSV
    - Defines helper variables (like lists of all bands)
    - Contains functions that filter and transform the data
    - Returns processed data for display
