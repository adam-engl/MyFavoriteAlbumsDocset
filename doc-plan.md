# Doc Plan: My Favorite Albums Data Analysis Software

## Executive Summary

My Favorite Albums is an R-based data analysis software that allows users to track, analyze, and visualize annual rankings of favorite music albums. The software consists of a Shiny web application with a tabbed interface that displays album data in various views, including rankings by year, artist information, and vinyl collection analysis. Users can filter data, compare bands, and explore top-rated albums across multiple years.

This docset aims to provide comprehensive guidance for both developers who want to understand and extend the codebase, and end users who want to use the application to analyze their own music collections. For developers, it will explain the code structure, data models, and how to modify or add new functionality. For end users, it will provide instructions on data formatting, interface navigation, and performing common analysis tasks.

The scope of this documentation includes conceptual overviews, task-oriented instructions, and reference documentation for all existing features of My Favorite Albums. It will not cover Shiny app deployment to production environments, advanced R programming concepts beyond what's used in the application, or database administration.

## Audiences

This documentation set targets two primary audiences:

**Developers**: These are individuals with some programming experience who want to understand the codebase, use the functions in the software, and potentially extend its functionality. They likely have basic knowledge of R programming but may not be familiar with Shiny web applications or data analysis libraries like dplyr. They need detailed information about code organization, function descriptions, and implementation examples to effectively modify or enhance the software.

**End Users**: These are music enthusiasts who want to use the software to analyze their album collections. Their technical expertise variesâ€”they may have basic familiarity with data formats like CSV but little to no programming experience. They need clear instructions on how to format their music data, navigate the interface, and interpret the various analyses and visualizations presented by the application.

Content for these audiences will be separated, with developer documentation focusing on code examples and technical implementation details, while end-user documentation will emphasize data preparation, UI navigation, and interpretation of results. Each document will clearly indicate its intended audience to help users quickly find relevant information.

## Proposed Documentation Set
